# CCAO-Property-Assessment-Values-Prediction
-	In the United States, taxes are collected at the county level, which requires the owners to pay a sum that is based on tax rates, along with levies for their locale, multiplied by the estimated or assessed value of the property. It is the government's job to determine the fair price of these properties. Assessment of the fair market value of the diverse parcels that are spread across over 130 municipalities is considered to be one of the most complex valuation tasks in the United States. Our role as the data scientist on the team is to predict the value of each home in the dataset as closely as possible to the actual value.
